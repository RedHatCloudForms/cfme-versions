Requirements
------------

- A `ruby` runtime


Installation
------------

### via `bundler`

Add the following to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'cfme-versions'
```


### via `rubygems`

```console
$ gem install cfme-versions
```


Versioning
----------

Ideally we will keep the version of this gem in-sync with the version of the
most recent numeric version of ManageIQ.  However, in the case of bug fixes,
patch versions might be included.

In the cases where a patch is needed, just update the `CFME::Versions.version`
to set the version directly. When a new version is released, reset the end of
the string to `+ ".0.0"` for consistency.

Note:  Previously the CFME version number was used to version this gem, but
since that is reaching EOL the decision was made to use the upstream
`miq_semver` variable instead as that project will continue forward.  This also
means the gem release "jumped" from `5.12` to `11.0.0`, but that is intentional
since `5.11` is the last CFME release.


Usage
-----

### CLI

```console
$ cfme-versions
```

There is a `--help` flag available for a few (minor) options.


### As a library

The `CFME::Versions` gem is also available as a `Enumerable` lib, so you can do
things like the following:

```ruby
require 'cfme-versions'

CFME::Versions.first.cfme_release
#=> "5.1.z"
CFME::Versions.first.cloud_forms_release
#=> "2.0"
CFME::Versions.last.miq_release
#=> "Jansa"
CFME::Versions.last.ruby
#=> "2.5.z"
CFME::Versions.last
#=> #<struct CFME::Version
#       miq_release="Jansa",
#       cfme_release="5.12.z",
#       cloud_forms_release="5.1",
#       ruby="2.5.z",
#       rails="5.2.z",
#       postgresql="10.y">
```


Contributing
------------

Bug reports and pull requests are welcome on [GitHub][].

If you wish to add a version to the list, make sure to run the tests and fix
any errors as a result (designed to fail when things change).

You can use `rake` to run the specs as you would expect.
